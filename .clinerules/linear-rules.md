This rule provides comprehensive guidance on using Linear effectively, adhering to the core principles and practices of the "Linear Method" to enhance productivity, maintain focus, and create momentum when managing software projects. Use this when discussing Linear tasks, planning cycles, structuring initiatives, or reviewing project progress.


### Core Principles

1. **Build for the Creators:** 
   - Prioritize keeping individual contributors (engineers, designers) productive
   - Focus on reducing friction for those doing the actual work
   - Design workflows that enhance creativity and flow, not interrupt it
   - Remember that reports and process tracking should serve the makers, not the other way around

2. **Purpose-Built Product Management:**
   - Recognize Linear's opinionated approach to project management
   - Embrace its specialized workflows rather than forcing traditional methodologies onto it
   - Understand Linear's vocabulary: Issues over Stories, Projects for features, Initiatives for epics/roadmap items
   - Accept that some traditional concepts are deliberately renamed or reimagined

3. **Create Momentum, Don't Sprint:**
   - Establish a sustainable cadence through fixed-length Cycles (typically 2-week)
   - Focus on steady, continuous progress rather than bursts of activity
   - Allow unfinished items to naturally roll over to the next cycle
   - Don't overload cycles with unrealistic expectations
   - Take swift action instead of getting caught in analysis paralysis
   - Generate momentum by focusing on progress each day (do it today, not tomorrow)

4. **Meaningful Direction:**
   - Connect daily work to larger strategic goals
   - Ensure Issues link to Projects, and Projects align with Initiatives
   - Keep the big picture visible while working on individual tasks
   - Have clear, compelling targets that give meaning to the daily work
   - Reference the project or initiative an issue belongs to in discussions

5. **Aim for Clarity:**
   - Use simple, direct language in all communications
   - Avoid inventing specialized terminology - use standard terms where possible
   - Write clear, concise issue titles that state exactly what needs to be done
   - Make descriptions optional but useful when included
   - Prefer concrete, specific tasks over ambiguous requests

6. **Say No to Busy Work:**
   - Eliminate or automate "work about work" wherever possible
   - Focus on tasks that deliver actual value
   - Don't create processes that require people to manage tools rather than produce work 
   - Question any ritual that feels like a burden without clear value
   - Automate repetitive tasks with Linear's native features

7. **Simple First, Then Powerful:**
   - Start with basic Linear features before adding complexity
   - Introduce advanced features (custom Views, Roadmaps, Initiatives) only as team scale requires them
   - Allow your Linear usage to evolve organically with your team's needs
   - Keep configurations minimal until proven necessary
   - Onboard new team members with the simplest possible workflow

8. **Decide and Move On:**
   - Prioritize forward progress over perfect decisions
   - Make choices and course-correct later if needed
   - Don't get stuck in decision paralysis for minor issues
   - Trust your intuition when data is incomplete
   - Accept that sometimes quick action with partial information beats thorough analysis that delays progress

### Key Practices

1. **Strategic Planning**
   - Set ambitious, meaningful product initiatives as high-level direction
   - Define clear goals that provide the 'why' behind your projects
   - Reserve capacity for unplanned work in your roadmap (typically 20%)
   - Prioritize enablers and blockers that unlock future work
   - Scope projects down to manageable sizes for execution

2. **Issue Management**
   - **Write Issues Not User Stories:**
     - Create direct, clear issues that describe concrete tasks in plain language
     - Skip the "As a user, I want to..." format in favor of descriptive task titles
     - Focus on the work to be done rather than the user motivation
     - Include context directly in the issue description when necessary
     - Trust that team members understand the product and user needs at a holistic level

   - **Issue Creation Best Practices:**
     - Write your own issues - the person doing the work should define it
     - Describe concrete tasks with clear, defined outcomes
     - Write clear, direct titles that explain what needs to be done
     - Make descriptions optional, including only relevant context
     - Quote user feedback directly rather than summarizing
     - Link to deeper discussions or specifications when available

3. **Workflow Optimization**
   - **Work in Cycles:**
     - Plan work in fixed-length cycles (typically 2 weeks)
     - Keep cycles reasonably loaded, not overcommitted
     - Let unfinished work roll over automatically
     - Review progress at cycle completion
     - Avoid changing plans mid-cycle unless critical

   - **Backlog Maintenance:**
     - Keep the backlog lean and focused
     - Regularly triage and archive/close unlikely issues
     - Don't preserve every feature request indefinitely
     - Trust that important issues will resurface if needed
     - Prioritize ruthlessly during cycle planning

   - **Quality Balance:**
     - Mix feature development with quality improvement
     - Include bugs and technical debt in each cycle
     - Invest in tooling as a force multiplier
     - Recognize that all software has bugs, more than you can ever fix
     - Be strategic about which quality issues to address

4. **Project Structure**
   - **Ownership and Accountability:**
     - Assign a clear owner for every project and issue
     - Make single individuals responsible for delivery
     - Ensure the project owner writes the brief and guides execution
     - Maintain accountability even with collaborative work
     - Provide owners the authority to make decisions

   - **Specs and Documentation:**
     - Write brief project specifications that communicate the why, what, and how
     - Aim for brevity - shorter specs are more likely to be read
     - Focus on communicating essential information
     - Use specs to clarify scope and priorities
     - Keep documentation lean but sufficient

5. **Building and Shipping**
   - **Generate Momentum:**
     - Take swift action rather than excessive discussion
     - Decide to do something or not do it, then execute immediately
     - Ship regularly to maintain rhythm and motivation
     - Trust intuition when direction isn't completely clear
     - Correct course as you go rather than waiting for perfect information

   - **User-Centered Development:**
     - Collect and organize user feedback systematically
     - Use feedback as a research library for new features
     - Attach user requests to relevant issues
     - Look for trends in feedback
     - Build with actual user needs in mind

   - **Breaking Down Work:**
     - Scope issues to be as small as possible
     - Create tasks that can be completed in hours or days, not weeks
     - Look for visible progress markers
     - Measure progress with actual work (code, design files, etc.)
     - Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes

   - **Collaborative Approach:**
     - Run cross-functional teams with designers and engineers
     - Allow natural push and pull between disciplines
     - Recognize that the best creators often have hybrid skills
     - Foster collaboration rather than handoffs
     - Build in public with regular updates and sharing

### Linear's Key Concepts

1. **Workspace Structure**
   - **Workspace:** The container for all issues, teams, and concepts for an organization
   - **Teams:** Groups of people who work together, or parts of a product, containing issues
   - **Issues:** Tasks representing work to be done, belonging to a team
   - **Projects:** Groups of issues toward a specific deliverable, like launching a feature
   - **Initiatives:** Organization of projects showcasing company-wide goals
   - **Cycles:** Time-boxed periods (similar to sprints) for completing defined work

2. **Issue Properties**
   - **Priority:** Urgency level (No priority, Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
   - **Status:** Current state within workflow (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, etc.)
   - **Labels:** Tags for categorizing issues (Bug, Improvement, Feature, etc.)
   - **Estimate:** Complexity or effort assessment
   - **Due Date:** Deadline for completion
   - **Assignee:** Person responsible for the issue

3. **Views and Navigation**
   - **My Issues:** Curated set showing assigned, created, and subscribed issues
   - **Inbox:** Notifications and updates requiring attention
   - **Project Views:** Dynamic filters showing projects by status
   - **Cycle Views:** Current and upcoming time-bounded work periods
   - **Custom Views:** Personalized filters for specific workflows

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Over-Ritualization:**
   - Creating complex processes that add more work than value
   - Forcing traditional methodologies onto Linear when they don't fit
   - Adhering to ceremonies without questioning their purpose
   - Treating Linear as a tool for managers rather than for makers

2. **Losing the User Perspective:**
   - Focusing so much on tasks that you lose sight of user needs
   - Failing to connect tasks to broader product goals
   - Not considering how features interact in the overall product experience
   - Building features without understanding their purpose in the user journey

3. **Overloading and Overcommitting:**
   - Packing cycles with more work than can realistically be completed
   - Creating a massive backlog that becomes impossible to manage
   - Setting unrealistic deadlines that lead to burnout
   - Not allowing space for unexpected work or discoveries

4. **Documentation Extremes:**
   - Either documenting excessively or not documenting at all
   - Writing overly detailed specifications that no one reads
   - Creating tasks without sufficient context for execution
   - Failing to capture the reasoning behind decisions

5. **Process Over Progress:**
   - Allowing process to become more important than forward movement
   - Getting stuck in planning loops instead of building
   - Spending more time managing Linear than creating valuable work
   - Focusing on perfect tracking rather than meaningful results

### Advanced Tips

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Learn essential shortcuts for common actions (C for create issue, Cmd/Ctrl+K for command menu)
   - Use navigation shortcuts (G+I for Inbox, G+V for cycle, G+B for backlog)
   - Master bulk actions with selection shortcuts (x to select, Shift+Up/Down for multiple)
   - Use Esc to go back or clear selections
   - Access the full shortcut reference with ? key

2. **Automation and Integration:**

   - Adjust team workflows as your organization grows
   - Create custom views for different roles and responsibilities
   - Develop team-specific label systems for better categorization
   - Consider using sub-teams for large organizations
   - Balance standardization with team-specific needs

4. **Long-term Planning:**
   - Use Initiatives for strategic, multi-quarter planning
   - Group related projects under common objectives
   - Set milestones within projects for incremental progress
   - Create a roadmap for communicating direction to stakeholders
   - Balance long-term vision with short-term execution
