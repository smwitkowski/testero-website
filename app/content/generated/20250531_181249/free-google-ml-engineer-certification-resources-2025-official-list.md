The free tier refreshes monthly, providing ongoing access to new content. Focus on labs covering Vertex AI, AutoML, BigQuery ML, and TensorFlow on Google Cloud. These directly align with PMLE exam objectives.

### Google Cloud Documentation

Often overlooked but incredibly valuable, Google's official documentation provides:

- **Comprehensive service guides** for all ML-related GCP services
- **Best practices documentation** for ML workflows
- **Code samples and tutorials** in multiple programming languages
- **Architecture patterns** for common ML use cases

The documentation is continuously updated and reflects the latest service capabilities. Create a systematic reading plan covering Vertex AI, AI Platform, BigQuery ML, and Cloud ML Engine documentation.

## Community Learning Materials

The machine learning community has created an ecosystem of free resources that complement Google's official materials. These community-driven resources often provide different perspectives and practical insights.

### GitHub Repositories

Several GitHub repositories offer comprehensive PMLE preparation materials:

**Awesome GCP Certifications** repository contains curated lists of free resources, practice questions, and study guides. The community actively maintains and updates these collections, ensuring current and relevant content.

**PMLE Study Guides** created by successful candidates provide real-world insights into exam preparation strategies. These repositories often include:
