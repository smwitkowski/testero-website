Landing a Google Machine Learning Engineer certification can transform your career, but who has months to prepare? If you're a working professional with limited time, this intensive 30-day study plan is designed specifically for you.

The Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE) exam covers six major domains, from ML problem framing to model deployment and monitoring. While Google recommends 3+ years of industry experience, the right preparation strategy can help you pass in just one month.

This isn't about cramming—it's about strategic learning. We'll focus on high-yield topics that appear most frequently on the exam, provide daily study schedules that fit around your work commitments, and give you hands-on practice with the tools you'll actually use.

**What makes this plan different?** Unlike generic study guides, this 30-day sprint prioritizes implementation over theory, uses real exam patterns to guide topic selection, and provides flexible scheduling options for busy professionals.
