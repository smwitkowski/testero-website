## <a id="exam-format"></a>1. Exam Format

### 1.1 Snapshot

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Question count** | 50–60 |
| **Duration** | 120 minutes ([How long is the Google ML Engineer exam?](/faq/how-long-is-the-google-ml-engineer-exam)) |
| **Format** | Multiple‑choice & multiple‑select |
| **Delivery** | Online proctored or test centre |
| **Cost** | $200 USD |
| **Passing score** | Not published (aim ≥ 70 %) |

> **Callout – Version Update**  
> The PMLE exam was **overhauled in Oct 2024** to add generative‑AI tooling (Model Garden, Vertex AI Agent Builder). Any resources older than that date are incomplete—verify study materials match the current blueprint.

### 1.2 Prerequisites

Google **recommends** 3 + years of industry experience (1 + year on GCP), but determined learners regularly succeed with less by combining:
- Solid Python and SQL foundations  
- Familiarity with core ML concepts (supervised vs. unsupervised, evaluation metrics, overfitting, drift)  
- Hands‑on projects in BigQuery ML, Vertex AI, or TensorFlow  

### 1.3 Retakes & Recertification

| Attempt | Wait Period |
|---|---|
| 1 → 2 | 14 days |
| 2 → 3 | 60 days |
| 3 → 4 | 365 days |

The credential expires every **24 months**. Google typically halves the renewal fee (~$100) and tests only on the current blueprint, keeping you sharp on new services.

## <a id="study-plan"></a>2. 30‑Day Study Plan

A month is tight but realistic if you focus on **deep practice over passive reading**. Allocate **2–3 hours on weekdays & 4–5 hours on weekends**.

| Week | Focus | Key Activities | Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W1 – Foundation** | Domains 1 & 2 | • Cloud Skills Boost "Data Engineering, ML & AI" path<br>• BigQuery ML + Vision/Natural Language API labs | Notes on feature engineering, API vs AutoML trade‑offs |
| **W2 – Build & Deploy** | Domains 3 & 4 | • TensorFlow on Vertex AI custom training<br>• Containerize model, deploy to Cloud Run<br>• A/B rollout with traffic splits | End‑to‑end prototype app in GitHub |
| **W3 – MLOps** | Domains 5 & 6 | • Vertex AI Pipelines + CI/CD via Cloud Build<br>• Monitoring with Cloud Logging, Error Reporting, custom drift alerts | Automated pipeline with model registry & alert rules |
| **W4 – Polish** | All domains | • 2 × full‑length timed practice exams<br>• Flashcards for products & quotas<br>• Review wrong answers → targeted lab repetition | ≥ 80 % on practice, exam booked |

> **Pro Tip**  
> Schedule your real exam **before** Week 4 begins. A fixed date injects useful pressure and forces backward planning.

## <a id="key-domains"></a>3. Key Exam Domains

### Domain Weighting

```

Monitoring & Responsible AI …… 21 %
Scaling Prototypes → Models …… 18 %
Automating ML Pipelines ………… 18 %
Serving & Scaling Models ……… 16 %
Low‑Code / Pre‑built AI ………… 13 %
Data & Model Collaboration ……… 14 %

```

### 3.1 Low‑Code AI (13 %)

**What's tested**

- BigQuery ML SQL syntax & inference  
- AutoML Vision / Tables / Vertex Forecasting  
- Pre‑trained APIs (Document AI, Video AI, Retail API)

**Study hacks**

- Memorize **when** AutoML outperforms pre‑built APIs (custom data, unsatisfied accuracy, domain uniqueness).  
- Practice a BigQuery ML logistic‑regression model end‑to‑end in under 30 min.

### 3.2 Data & Model Collaboration (14 %)

Focus on cross‑team workflows:

- Data governance, PII handling, DLP API  
- Responsible AI policy (bias testing, interpretability)  
- Stakeholder alignment during experimentation

> **Callout – Responsible AI**  
> Google expects engineers to **design for fairness & security from day 1**, not bolt it on after deployment.

### 3.3 Scaling Prototypes → Models (18 %)

Key skills:

- Vertex AI SDK, custom training images  
- Hyperparameter tuning with Vizier  
- Distributed training on TPU / multi‑GPU  
- Performance tuning (batch size, mixed precision)

### 3.4 Serving & Scaling (16 %)

- Multi‑model endpoints vs one‑model‑per‑endpoint  
- Cloud Run vs Vertex Prediction vs GKE Autopilot  
- Canary & shadow traffic patterns  
- Latency troubleshooting (Cold‑start mitigation)

### 3.5 Automating ML Pipelines (18 %)

- Vertex AI Pipelines (KFP v2) components & DSL  
- CI/CD: Cloud Source Repos / GitHub → Cloud Build → Artifact Registry  
- Metadata tracking (ML Metadata store, lineage)  
- Model versioning & rollback

### 3.6 Monitoring & Responsible AI (21 %)

- Vertex Model Monitoring (skew & drift thresholds)  
- Custom drift detection with Cloud Functions  
- Security: IAM least privilege, private service connect, CMEK  
- Incident response playbooks

## <a id="sample-questions"></a>4. Sample Questions

> **Disclaimer**: These are **original practice items**, **not** actual exam questions, but they replicate style and difficulty.

### Q1 – Service Selection  
Your team needs to classify millions of documents daily. Accuracy is paramount; a small labelled dataset exists. Which approach maximizes accuracy **and** minimizes time ‑to‑value?

A. Fine‑tune PaLM 2 in Model Garden  
B. Train a custom text model in Vertex AI from scratch  
C. Use AutoML Text Classification on Vertex AI  
D. Call Cloud Natural Language API for each document  

**Answer**: C. AutoML provides high accuracy with limited data and fast deployment, beating pre‑trained (low accuracy) and custom (long timeline) options.

---

### Q2 – Pipeline Design  
You manage a pipeline with data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps. A new compliance rule requires auditability of every model artifact. What is the **simplest** way to meet the requirement?

A. Export artifacts to Cloud Storage and manually update a spreadsheet  
B. Add a Vertex ML Metadata sink to the pipeline for artifact lineage  
C. Enable VPC Service Controls around GCS buckets  
D. Write Cloud Logging filters and forward logs to BigQuery  

**Answer**: B. Vertex ML Metadata automatically tracks and stores lineage without manual work, satisfying audit needs.

---

### Q3 – Monitoring  
A production model's **precision** dropped sharply overnight, while recall stayed stable. What's the most likely root cause?

A. Label noise from annotation errors  
B. Concept drift in the minority class  
C. Data schema change removed a feature  
D. Class‑imbalance increased in incoming data  

**Answer**: D. Precision drop with stable recall often signals higher false positives, common when class balance shifts.

---

### Q4 – Cost vs Latency  
You serve an image‑classification model with tight 80 ms latency SLO. Traffic is spiky: 0–500 RPS. Which deployment minimizes **both** cost and cold‑start latency?

A. Vertex AI Prediction Standard Tier  
B. Cloud Run min instances = 0, max instances = 20  
C. Cloud Run min instances = 1, CPU / mem tuned, concurrency = 10  
D. GKE Autopilot with horizontal pod autoscaling  

**Answer**: C. One warm instance controls cold starts; Cloud Run scales down to 1 during idle, cheaper than always‑on Vertex Prediction.

---

## <a id="next-steps"></a>5. Next Steps

### 5.1 Build Your Personalized Plan
1. **Book the exam**—commitment drives action.  
2. Copy the **30‑day study table** into your calendar.  
3. Reserve **hands‑on lab credits** (Qwiklabs / Cloud Skills Boost).  
4. Assemble a **study squad**—accountability improves throughput.  

### 5.2 Leverage the Credential
- **LinkedIn**: Add the digital badge and a short post summarizing your prep journey.  
- **Resume**: Pair the cert with quantified project outcomes (e.g., *"Cut inference latency 40 % on Vertex AI"*).  
- **Internal Advocacy**: Host a lunch‑and‑learn; teaching reinforces mastery and boosts internal visibility.  

### 5.3 Level‑Up Paths
| Next Certification | Why It Pairs Well |
|---|---|
| **Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer** | Complements ML with data pipelines & warehousing |
| **Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer** | Deepens CI/CD & reliability for ML services |
| **TensorFlow Developer Certificate** | Showcases framework‑specific expertise |
| **AWS Machine Learning Specialty** | Validates multi‑cloud versatility |
