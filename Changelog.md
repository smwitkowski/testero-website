## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Build Failure**: Fixed ESLint error `react/no-unescaped-entities` in `app/signup/page.tsx` by escaping apostrophe in "We've" text using HTML entity `&#39;`
- **Build Environment**: Added placeholder Supabase environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to `.env.local` to allow build completion
- **Dependencies**: Resolved missing build dependencies (`ts-node`, `prettier`) that were preventing the build process from completing

### Changed
- Production build now successfully generates optimized static content for all 26 pages
- Sitemap generation now handles missing Supabase connection gracefully during build process
