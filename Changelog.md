## [Unreleased]
- Added `/api/auth/signup` API route for Supabase sign-up with email/password, default `early_access: false` metadata, and clean JSON responses.
- Implemented in-memory rate limiting (5 requests/minute per IP) for sign-up route. Added comments for production upgrade.
- Added server-side PostHog instrumentation for signup attempts, success, errors, and rate limiting.
- Added Jest tests for signup API covering valid, invalid, rate-limited, and duplicate email scenarios.
- Refactored signup business logic into a pure function (`signupBusinessLogic`) in `lib/auth/signup-handler.ts` for testability and maintainability.
- API route now injects Supabase and analytics dependencies into the handler.
- Unit tests updated to target the pure handler directly, removing all Web API and Next.js dependencies from the test environment.
- Fixed TypeScript errors in signup tests by adding proper response types and type assertions.
- Added TypeScript response type definitions (`SignupResponse`, `SignupSuccessResponse`, `SignupErrorResponse`) to signup handler.
- Created comprehensive Cursor rules for TypeScript testing patterns, Next.js project structure, and development workflow.
